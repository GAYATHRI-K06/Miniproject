## Title of the Project
AI-Powered Social Media Ad Performance Predictor

The AI-Powered Social Media Ad Predictor is designed to analyze social media advertisements and predict their engagement performance using machine learning techniques, helping marketers optimize ad content before deployment.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The AI-Powered Social Media Ad Performance Predictor is an intelligent system developed to estimate the expected engagement of social media advertisements based on both visual and textual features. In today’s digital marketing landscape, creating effective advertisements requires understanding how images, captions, and overall presentation influence user engagement.

This project integrates deep learning for image feature extraction and natural language processing for text analysis. By combining these features, the system predicts an engagement score that indicates how well an advertisement is likely to perform. The solution helps advertisers, marketers, and content creators make data-driven decisions, reduce trial-and-error costs, and improve campaign effectiveness.```
